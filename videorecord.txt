Phase 4: Video Recording Script
Your Goal: Create a script for your 5-minute video presentation.


Introduction (30 seconds):

"Hi, this is my submission for ITD105 Lab Exercise 2 on Resampling and Performance Metrics."

Phase 1: Classification (1 minute):

"First, I built two classification models for the Pima Diabetes dataset."

"Model A used K-Fold Cross-Validation. Model B used Leave-One-Out."

(Show the terminal output from classification.py) "As you can see, both models had very similar performance, but K-Fold was much faster. I selected Model A."

Phase 2: Regression (1 minute):

"Next, I built two regression models for the Boston Housing dataset."

"Model A used a simple Train-Test split. Model B used Repeated Random Splits."

(Show the terminal output from regression.py) "Model B gave a more robust performance estimate, so I selected it as my final model."

Phase 3: Streamlit Demo (2 minutes):

(Have the streamlit run app.py browser window open)

"This is my final Streamlit application, which serves both selected models."

Demo Classification: "On the Classification tab, we can enter patient data in the sidebar. For example, if I enter these values... [enter sample data]... and click 'Predict', the app correctly predicts the outcome and confidence."

Demo Regression: "On the Regression tab, we can enter housing data. For example... [enter sample data]... and click 'Predict', the app gives us a predicted housing price."

Conclusion (30 seconds):

"This project successfully implemented, compared, and deployed two machine learning models using different resampling techniques. Thank you for watching."

After you record this video, you will have all the required items for submission:

Your .py files (classification.py, regression.py, app.py)

Your datasets (diabetes.csv, boston_housing.csv)

Your video recording

Congratulations on completing the project!
